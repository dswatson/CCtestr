Description: M3C provides a hypothesis testing framework for cluster validation.
  Using a modified consensus clustering algorithm, we calculate PAC scores for 
  data simulated from an input matrix in order to estimate the theoretical null 
  distribution of each cluster number k's performance metrics. Results for real 
  data are subsequently evaluated relative to these null distributions. By 
  systematically testing against well-formulated null hypotheses, we generate 
  test statistics and p-values with high accuracy and known precision.
