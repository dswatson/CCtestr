Description: M3C provides a hypothesis testing framework for consensus 
  clustering. Null datasets are generated from an input matrix to create 
  relevant reference distributions for performance metrics. Real data is then 
  evaluated relative to these null distributions to evaluate cluster stability 
  against random noise. By systematically testing each cluster number k against 
  a well formulated null hypothesis, we can generate test statistics and 
  p-values for each.
